Hi users,
This is Akansh Jha.
You can use this executable file, to extract your zip files. Following are the steps you can perform -

NOTE : It does not unzip the password protected files.

1. Download this 'UnzipFiles.exe' file.
2. Collect all the zip files, to be unzipped, in a folder.
3. Copy this 'UnzipFiles.exe' file in the same folder with other zips.
4. Double Click on the 'UnzipFiles.exe' file. 
   You will see a black console.

   Voila, Unzipping is started. Once the console is disappeared means unzipping is finished.

If you think, unzipping is not proper. Please go through the 'log.log' file to debug.

If you are not able to figure the error out, feel free to reach out to me on 'akansh.jha@gmail.com'.

Or If you want any other such executables, you know, where you can find me.

Thanks for reading.
